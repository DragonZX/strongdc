Info INF - node details
- NI = user's nick
- U4 = UDP port (to avoid UDP abuse, client should use UDP in datagram)
- RE = 1=requires node INF response, 2=bootstrap request
- NX = nodes in XML format in response to bootstrap request
- other ADC flags (SS, SL etc.) are allowed to but they are not used now

Request REQ - requests for node list closest to target
- TR = target
- TO = token
- MN = maximum nodes in node list (2-searching for file, 4-want to publish file, 12-searching for node)

Search SCH - searches for TTH in the network
- TR = TTH root
- TO = token

Publish PUB - requests for file publishing
- TR = TTH root
- SI = file size

Response RES - response to REQ/SCH/PUB
- TO = token
- NX = node list in XML format (in response to REQ)
- SX = sources list in XML format: ip, tcp, udp (in response to SCH)
---> SX and NX are exclusive!!!

TODO:
* getClosestTo - avoid sending possibly dead nodes
* consolidate small neighbouring buckets
* something about TLS support
* make settings for bootstrap URL
* make lifetime for published files
* anti-flooding system
* ping (INF) possibly dead nodes before removing
* handle partial file sharing
* save nicks???
* stop searches when maximum responses reached
* private messaging
* test and test and test and t...
